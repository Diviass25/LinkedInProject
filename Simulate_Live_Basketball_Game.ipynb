        "*   **Real-time Game Metrics Calculation**: As each play was ingested, the following metrics were continuously updated and displayed:\n",
        "    *   Current scores for both teams (Lakers and Celtics).\n",
        "    *   The leading team and the score difference.\n",
        "    *   Individual player statistics for points, assists, and rebounds.\n",
        "    *   Team field goal percentages, calculated from made and attempted shots, handling division by zero for initial plays.\n",
        "*   **Dynamic Live Visualization**: The simulation included dynamic visualizations that updated periodically (every 10 events or at the end of the game). These visualizations comprised:\n",
        "    *   A line chart showing the live score progression of both teams over time.\n",
        "    *   A bar chart displaying the top 5 players by points, which updated as player statistics evolved.\n",
        "    These plots were rendered dynamically, reflecting the real-time nature of the game flow and metric changes."
